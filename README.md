## Coding transformer language model from scratch where we model a sequence of characters.

- We use a small dataset- tinyShakespeare which is a concatenation of all of Shakespeare's work.

- The model will learn how the characters follow each other, ie given a context of characters, the transformer neural network will predict the next character.
